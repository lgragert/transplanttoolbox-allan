Transplant tool box-ALLAN:  HLA molecular typing data to antigen conversion for virtual crossmatch


Description
===========

The organ allocation computer matching system used by United Network Organ Sharing (UNOS)
requires molecular HLA typing data of transplant candidates and donor organs to be reported as
UNOS antigen equivalents for entry into UNet. This web tool maps ambiguous or unambiguous
HLA typing data to respective antigens based on UNOS OPTN guidelines. A list of UNOS antigen
equivalents is returned as output. Ambiguous typings use National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)
allele frequencies to calculate antigen probabilities and assign the most probable antigens for each
locus.
